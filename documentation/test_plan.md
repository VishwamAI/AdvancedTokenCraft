# Test Plan for Custom Tokenizer

## Overview
This document outlines the test plan for the `CustomTokenizer` class in the AdvancedTokenCraft project. The goal is to ensure that the tokenizer functions correctly and efficiently, incorporating unique features from GPT-2, BERT, and Meta Llama.

## Key Functionalities to Test
1. Tokenization Process
2. Encoding and Decoding Methods
3. Handling of Special Tokens
4. Integration of Unique Features from GPT-2, BERT, and Meta Llama
5. Handling of Large Inputs
6. Error Handling and Edge Cases

## Test Cases

### 1. Tokenization Process
- **Test Case 1.1:** Tokenize a simple sentence.
- **Test Case 1.2:** Tokenize a sentence with special characters.
- **Test Case 1.3:** Tokenize a sentence with multiple spaces.
- **Test Case 1.4:** Tokenize an empty string.

### 2. Encoding and Decoding Methods
- **Test Case 2.1:** Encode and decode a simple sentence.
- **Test Case 2.2:** Encode and decode a sentence with special characters.
- **Test Case 2.3:** Encode and decode a sentence with multiple spaces.
- **Test Case 2.4:** Encode and decode an empty string.

### 3. Handling of Special Tokens
- **Test Case 3.1:** Encode and decode a sentence with special tokens (e.g., <|begin_of_text|>, <|end_of_text|>).
- **Test Case 3.2:** Ensure special tokens are correctly handled during tokenization.

### 4. Integration of Unique Features from GPT-2, BERT, and Meta Llama
- **Test Case 4.1:** Verify the integration of GPT-2's byte-level BPE.
- **Test Case 4.2:** Verify the integration of BERT's WordPiece tokenization.
- **Test Case 4.3:** Verify the integration of Meta Llama's regex pattern.

### 5. Handling of Large Inputs
- **Test Case 5.1:** Tokenize, encode, and decode a large input string.
- **Test Case 5.2:** Ensure efficient handling of large inputs without performance degradation.

### 6. Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Test Case 6.1:** Handle unknown tokens during encoding.
- **Test Case 6.2:** Handle invalid input types (e.g., non-string inputs).
- **Test Case 6.3:** Handle cases where the model is not loaded (self.model is None).

## Conclusion
This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the `CustomTokenizer` class, ensuring that it functions correctly and efficiently. By implementing these test cases, we can identify and address any issues, leading to a robust and reliable tokenization model.
